# Minimal Configuration

The simplest way to set up AutoArm is through the UI: go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Add Integration**, search for **AutoArm**, and select your alarm panel. No YAML is needed for a basic setup.

## Legacy YAML Reference

For reference, the equivalent YAML-only configuration lives inside `config.yaml` or an include file set up for the `autoarm` domain.

``` yaml
--8<-- "examples/minimal.yaml"
```
