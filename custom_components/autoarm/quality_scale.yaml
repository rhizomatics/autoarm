  action-setup:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Services (reload, enquire_configuration, reset_state) are registered in
      async_setup in autoarming.py:132-161 and autoarming.py:302-307.

  appropriate-polling:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      This integration is primarily event-driven (state changes, sunrise/sunset,
      button presses, mobile actions). Calendar polling is configurable per-calendar
      with sensible defaults (30 seconds).

  brands:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Brand assets submitted and approved in the Home Assistant brands repository.

  common-modules:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Common patterns are placed in dedicated modules: const.py (constants/schemas),
      helpers.py (utilities), hass_api.py (HA API wrapper), calendar.py (calendar logic).

  config-flow:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Config flow implemented in config_flow.py with user flow (3 steps:
      alarm panel, calendars, persons), YAML import flow, and options flow.
      Advanced config (transitions, buttons, notify, diurnal, rate_limit)
      remains in YAML.

  config-flow-test-coverage:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Config flow tests in tests/autoarm/test_config_flow.py cover user flow,
      minimal flow, duplicate abort, import flow, import abort, and options flow.

  dependency-transparency:
    status: done
    comment: |
      All dependencies are standard Home Assistant components (sun, alarm_control_panel,
      mobile_app, calendar, local_calendar, notify) declared in manifest.json.
      No external Python packages are required.

  docs-actions:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Services are documented in services.yaml and README.md describes the reload,
      enquire_configuration, and reset_state actions.

  docs-high-level-description:
    status: done
    comment: |
      README.md provides a clear overview of AutoArm's purpose: automating alarm
      control panel state based on occupancy, time, calendar events, and manual
      interventions.

  docs-installation-instructions:
    status: done
    comment: |
      README.md includes HACS installation instructions and links to detailed
      configuration guides.

  docs-removal-instructions:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Removal instructions documented in docs/removal.md covering HACS
      removal, manual removal, and cleanup steps.

  entity-event-setup:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Entity event subscriptions are set up in dedicated initialize_* methods
      called from initialize() in autoarming.py:261-274, using proper HA event
      tracking functions (async_track_state_change_event, async_track_sunrise, etc.).

  entity-unique-id:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      Entities are created using hass.states.async_set() with fixed entity IDs
      (e.g., sensor.autoarm_failures, binary_sensor.autoarm_initialized). These
      are integration-scoped singletons, not device-based entities requiring
      unique IDs.

  has-entity-name:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      Entities are created directly via hass.states.async_set() rather than
      entity classes, so has_entity_name is not applicable. Entity IDs follow
      the pattern sensor.autoarm_* which is consistent and discoverable.

  runtime-data:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Runtime data is stored using HassKey[AutoArmData] in autoarming.py:96
      and accessed via hass.data[HASS_DATA_KEY].

  test-before-configure:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Config flow validates alarm panel entity selection. Import flow validates
      YAML structure. Schema validation via voluptuous in const.py.

  test-before-setup:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Setup validates configuration via CONFIG_SCHEMA (voluptuous) and checks
      for required config in async_setup. async_setup_entry raises
      ConfigEntryNotReady on initialization failure so HA retries.
      Transition conditions are validated during initialize_logic() with
      issues raised via the repair system for invalid configs.

  unique-config-entry:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Config flow sets unique_id = DOMAIN and calls _abort_if_unique_id_configured()
      to prevent duplicate entries. Only one AutoArm instance is supported.

  action-exceptions:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Service handlers raise HomeAssistantError on failure: reload raises on
      YAML parse errors, enquire_configuration raises when no entry exists or
      serialization fails.

  config-entry-unloading:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Integration supports unloading via shutdown() method (autoarming.py:458-466)
      which properly cleans up all listeners. Reload service also calls shutdown
      before reinitializing (autoarming.py:128-130).

  docs-configuration-parameters:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Configuration parameters are documented in docs/automated_arming.md and
      example configurations in docs/configuration/examples/.

  docs-installation-parameters:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      No installation parameters required; YAML-only configuration.

  entity-unavailable:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Entities are set to "unavailable" state when appropriate, e.g.,
      sensor.autoarm_last_calculation and sensor.autoarm_last_calendar_event
      are initialized to "unavailable" (autoarming.py:300, 374).

  integration-owner:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Code owner @jeyrb is declared in manifest.json and actively maintains
      the integration.

  log-when-unavailable:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Logging uses consistent "AUTOARM" prefix throughout. State transitions
      are logged at appropriate levels (debug for routine, info for changes,
      warning/error for issues).

  parallel-updates:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      This integration doesn't poll external devices in parallel. Calendar
      polling is handled per-calendar with independent timers.

  reauthentication-flow:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      No authentication required; this integration orchestrates local HA
      entities only.

  test-coverage:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Test suite maintains >90% coverage with --cov-fail-under=90 enforced
      in pyproject.toml.

  devices:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      This integration doesn't represent physical devices. It orchestrates
      existing alarm_control_panel, person, calendar, and button entities.

  diagnostics:
    status: done
    comment: |
      diagnostics.py exposes config entry data, options, YAML keys, and
      armer runtime state (alarm panel, calendar count, person entities,
      health tracker status).

  discovery:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      This integration orchestrates user-configured entities; there is nothing
      to discover automatically.

  discovery-update-info:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      No discovery; not applicable.

  docs-data-update:
    status: done
    comment: |
      README.md and automated_arming.md describe how data is updated via
      event listeners, calendar polling, and manual triggers.

  docs-examples:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Example configurations are provided in docs/configuration/examples/
      including minimal.md and typical.md. Mobile action examples in
      docs/mobile_actions.md.

  docs-known-limitations:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Known limitations documented in docs/known_limitations.md covering
      single panel, YAML-only advanced features, calendar polling, manual
      intervention lock, and panel compatibility.

  docs-supported-devices:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      This integration works with any alarm_control_panel, person, calendar,
      and button entities. No specific device compatibility to document.

  docs-supported-functions:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Supported functionality (occupancy tracking, calendar integration,
      button control, mobile actions, notifications) is documented in
      README.md and automated_arming.md.

  docs-troubleshooting:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Troubleshooting guide in docs/troubleshooting.md covering common issues
      with state changes, calendar detection, notifications, repair issues,
      and debug logging.

  docs-use-cases:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Use cases are illustrated in README.md ("Why use alarm control panels?"
      section) and throughout the documentation.

  dynamic-devices:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      No device registry usage; not applicable.

  entity-category:
    status: todo
    comment: |
      Entities created via async_set don't use EntityCategory. Could be
      improved if refactored to use entity classes.

  entity-device-class:
    status: todo
    comment: |
      Entities don't specify device classes. binary_sensor.autoarm_initialized
      could use a diagnostic device class.

  entity-disabled-by-default:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      All exposed entities are essential for operation and debugging. None
      are noisy or rarely used.

  entity-translations:
    status: todo
    comment: |
      Entity names are hardcoded in English. Translations would require
      refactoring to use entity classes with translation keys.

  exception-translations:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Issue messages use translation keys in strings.json with placeholders
      (e.g., transition_condition issue).

  icon-translations:
    status: todo
    comment: |
      No icon translations implemented; entities don't have custom icons.

  reconfiguration-flow:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Options flow in config_flow.py allows changing calendar entities, person
      entities, occupancy defaults, and no-event mode via the UI. Changes
      trigger an entry reload.

  repair-issues:
    status: done
    comment: |
      Repair issues are raised for invalid transition conditions via
      hass_api.raise_issue() (autoarming.py:445-451). Uses proper translation
      keys and severity levels.

  stale-devices:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      No device registry usage; not applicable.

  async-dependency:
    status: done
    comment: |
      No external dependencies; all code uses Home Assistant's async APIs.

  inject-websession:
    status: exempt
    comment: |
      No external HTTP calls requiring websession injection.

  strict-typing:
    status: in progress
    comment: |
      Type hints are used throughout. py.typed marker is present. Some `Any`
      types remain due to HA ConfigType and service data patterns.
